üìò **Set priorities**
After Reading 'The ONE Thing' (25.08.03)
When I wrote my year-end and new-year-start articles for 2025, one of my resolutions was to read a book and write a reflection on it once a month. Now, after reading "The ONE Thing," I am putting that into practice.
"The ONE Thing" is a book that offers a great deal of inspiration to its readers. Furthermore, to make it easy to apply its lessons after reading, each chapter includes a "Key Concept." I focused on reading these key concepts in detail. I want to write about what I felt and how I will apply them, using the "Appendix: How to Apply the ONE Thing to Real Life" as a guide.
First, the meaning of the phrase "The ONE Thing" begins with the question, "What is the method to draw out the greatest power from a single thing?"
What is the ONE Thing I can do this week to discover or confirm my life's purpose?
My ONE Thing is writing (this reflection, and an article to close out July and begin August) to set my future resolutions and plans.
What is the ONE Thing I can do today to finish my current project ahead of schedule?
While I'm not working on a formal project, my ONE Thing is to take my planned Java course. It is a fact that I have been delaying it for too long. Therefore, my plan for today is to finish the sections on Java's memory structure and the static keyword, based on the course PDF.
I will move forward through these plans and resolutions.
There are several sentences from the book that have stuck with me.
Say 'No'.
To achieve what I want, the ability to refuse is incredibly important. The moment you say 'yes' to something else, it will interfere with protecting your own top priority. Learning how to say 'no' can set you free. That is the path to finding time for your ONE Thing.
Accept the chaos.
Acknowledge that when you pursue your ONE Thing, other tasks may be postponed. Unfinished work might seem like a snare, holding you back and blocking your path. However, since this type of chaos is unavoidable, you must acknowledge and accept it. Then, learn how to deal with it. The success you achieve by accomplishing your ONE Thing will prove that you made the right decision.
Do your best.
You can only achieve extraordinary results when you put forth your best effort to become the best at what matters most to you. In short, this is the path to mastery.
Be purposeful about your ONE Thing.
Move from challenge to purpose. Find the role models and systems that can take you the furthest. Don't stop where it feels easy and comfortable; instead, embrace new ways of thinking, new skills, and new relationships. If becoming an expert is a promise to do your best, then having a sense of purpose is a promise to achieve it with the best possible approach.
As shown above, the book "The ONE Thing" seems to set the direction for the path I want to take. It will take a long time to get where I want to go. However, I will shorten that time by setting priorities and starting with what is most important. This focus on priorities will inevitably create chaos in terms of other results. My conclusion from this book is to effectively manage that chaos and do my best to cross the finish line I have set for myself.
