ðŸª¶ **Imposible is Nothing**

- "Failure is a part of success."
- "Without haste, but without rest."
- "Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about."
- "A cautious gene is a disadvantage in this day and age. In the past, new challenges were directly linked to survival, but that is no longer the case. Even if you fail, you won't die. However, our cowardly kluge and lazy brain command us, 'Don't do anything pointless, just eat potato chips.' In reality, doing nothing in today's world results in a 'deprivation of freedom'â€”a life shackled by money and time, without ever being in control. In an era where challenge and innovation have become paramount, the cowardly kluge is a major obstacle to self-development."
